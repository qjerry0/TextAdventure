say You are in a brightly lit room. On one side, a large window covers nearly the entire wall. Through the window you see a vast expanse of starlight. It must be night. In the floor you can make out the outlines of some objects. There must be a button somewhere for these things to pop up so you can see what they are. There are three doors. The left door leads into the closet where you started, the two other doors have the signs "Armory" and "Hallway" above them.
