say You are in a fairly long hallway, well illuminated by a line of ceiling lights. Several doors are along this hallway, most of which have illuminated lights indicating where they lead. On one side of the hallway doors lead to the control room, the library, and the cafeteria. The other side of the hallway leads to an an unknown room behind a circular glass door before before going downstairs, though rubble seems to have blocked this part off. The glass door is too grimy to see through.
