say You open the door. It opens silently, just like everything else about this place. A rectangular room, this place appears to be an armory of sorts, stocked full of strange types of weaponry. One wall is full of long marksman's rifles, it appears to be locked behind a single pane of glass. Another contains a set of smaller handguns. In the center of the room, several batons are attached in rows to a stand. Why would these people need weapons? Perhaps there’s danger here. You also notice something about this room isn't nearly as clean feeling as the others, the light is a distinct reddish color and the floors and ceiling are made of metal beams and grills.
